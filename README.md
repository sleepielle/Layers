# 🎨 Layers Landing Page
![Hero](/src/assets/gifs/hero.gif) 

> A **pixel-perfect implementation** of a Figma community design, built with **Next.js**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Framer Motion**. The goal was to recreate the design faithfully, while also adding a **component-based architecture** and **motion design integration** to elevate the user experience.

## 🧪 Development Process

1. **Figma Analysis** : Extracted spacing, colors, typography, and layout specs  
2. **Component Breakdown** : Divided the UI into modular, reusable components  
3. **Implementation** : Built layout using TailwindCSS utilities  
4. **Motion Design** : Added Framer Motion for smooth section transitions  
5. **Refinement** : Adjusted minor inconsistencies and visual flow  

The goal was to implement the Figma design with precision, ensuring a pixel-perfect landing page.

## 🪄 What I Learned
- I learnt how to bridge static designs and production-ready code by managing responsiveness and motion without breaking design fidelity.
- I learnt how to use the Motion framework to create beautiful animations to enhance static designs.
- Polished my UI/UX skills to guarantee a seamless and attractive page, positioning the user at the centre of the project.
